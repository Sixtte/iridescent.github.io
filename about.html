        <h1>About The Team</h1>
        <P>
            Iridescent is a film and visual effects team who are commited to bringing to light the best of the best.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Founded in 2016, the team started off as a small group of people who enjoyed vfx and the creation of multidimensional compositions. Originally inspired by those who created Fractal and Relative, Iridescent was created to compile the collection of the industries best editorial teams into one close knit organisation.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The purpose of the websites creation was to expand the accessibility of the team to more than the select few that form the Iridescence team.
        </P>
